# P3-Spam-Message-Detector-
<html>
<body>
 <p>
   The project focuses on the classification of spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically applying Naive Bayes and CountVectorizer. Spam emails continue to be a significant problem, affecting communication efficiency and user experience, making the automation of spam detection crucial for modern email systems.
 </p>
  <h3>
    Problem Statement:
  </h3>
  <p>
    Spam emails are often designed to bypass traditional filtering mechanisms, causing users to receive unwanted or malicious messages. Manual identification is time-consuming, and automated solutions need to be efficient and accurate.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Objectives:
  </h3>
  <p>
    1.	Develop a machine learning model to classify emails as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam).<br>
    2.	Utilize NLP techniques, such as text preprocessing, tokenization, and vectorization, to represent email content in a suitable format for machine learning.<br>
    3.	Evaluate the performance of the Naive Bayes algorithm in comparison to other classification models.<br>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Methodology:
  </h3>
  <p>
    The project uses the Enron Email Dataset, which contains labeled examples of spam and ham emails. Text preprocessing steps like removing stopwords, punctuation, and stemming are performed. The CountVectorizer technique is used to convert email content into a bag-of-words representation. The Naive Bayes classifier, a probabilistic machine learning model, is applied to train the model on the dataset. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used for evaluation.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Conclusion:
  </h3>
  <p>
    The use of Naive Bayes and CountVectorizer effectively classifies emails into spam and ham categories, offering a reliable solution for automated email filtering. This method provides a solid foundation for building efficient spam detection systems in real-world applications.
